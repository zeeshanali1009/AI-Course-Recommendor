## 📘 AI‑Course‑Recommendor

**AI‑Course‑Recommendor** is a machine learning‑powered system designed to help learners discover relevant online courses based on their interests, skills, or past course interactions. It uses artificial intelligence techniques — such as content‑based filtering (text similarity of course descriptions) and collaborative‑filtering approaches — to recommend courses that match the user’s preferences and learning goals.

This kind of system processes available course metadata (like titles, descriptions, categories, ratings, and skill tags) and applies algorithms (e.g., cosine similarity, TF‑IDF, KNN) to compute personalized suggestions. By doing this, the recommender can suggest courses *that are most likely to benefit the user*, saving time and helping learners navigate large catalogs of online education offerings.
